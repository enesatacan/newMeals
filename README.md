# newMeals
I aimed to develop a food discovery application through the “https://www.themealdb.com/api.php” API, which contains information such as valid dishes, ingredients and recipes for many nationalities and categories.

New Dishes App is a web application that can search on recipes and categories and provides random food suggestions to the user. Using TheMealDB API, recipes and categories are pulled through the API.

Features Food Category Selection: Users can select food categories and view the dishes belonging to that category. Food Search: Users can access recipes and ingredients by searching by dish name. Random Food Suggestion: Users can receive a random meal suggestion. Recipe and Ingredient Details: Recipes and ingredients are easily accessible. Technologies HTML5 CSS3 JavaScript (ES6+) Fetch API (for data retrieval with TheMealDB API) Bootstrap (for responsive design) Font Awesome (for Icons)
